Meteu	Brothers, some have been found who are willing to spend themselves in serving others. Yet they have not felt the fire, they have not heard the Admonition, they have not seen the Arrow. They must be willing to go upon a jouney, and it is only right for us to stand by them through their ordeals until they enter into the bond of Brotherhood.	blue
Nutiket	Each one who comes to us must find us ever Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, and Clean. I will remind us of our duty to keep ourselves "physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight." I will guard the entrance, and open the way to those who are ready.	purple
Kichkinet	Each one who comes to us must find us ever Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, and Kind. I will remind us of our duty "to help other people at all times." I will guide them,and I will answer for them.	green
Allowat Sakima	Each one who comes to us must find us ever Trustworthy, Loyal, Obedient, and Reverent. I will remind us of our duty to God and country. If these virtues glow brightly in our hearts, the fire cannot fail to be kindled in theirs.	red
Allowat Sakima	Brothers, we are ready.	red
Nutiket	Awake, my friends. You now are starting on a long and toilsome journey. But before you undertake it you must Be Prepared completely.	purple
Nutiket	Pause, and look back on Scouting whose sign and motto you accepted. Long ago you gave your promise, said you firmly, "On my honor I'll do my best"-I'll do my duty. It is plain to all who watch you. We know this, for your companions, taking note of your devotion to the high ideals of Scouting, have proposed you to the Order.	purple
Nutiket	You were sent to seek a vision of yourselves, and of your purpose. We will each present a challeng to assist you in this quest, for we are here to help you on as far as man can guide his brother. Fifteen blazes led you to us, but the trail that you have followed becomes rougher, steeper, fainter: you will need a brighter fire.	purple
Nutiket	I, Nutiket, am the guardian of the circle, and I urge you: Seek the fire at the center! Kindle cheerfulness within you! Gather round your hearts the tinder, lay the oak and the pine together, kindle all that is within you with a warm and cheerful spirit. The spark is there, already glowing, fan it now, forgetting hunger, feed it, till it is a fire.	purple
Nutiket	So tomorrow eat you nothing but the scant food you'll be given. So tomorrow learn by fasting, sacrifice, and self-denial to subordinate desires to the spirit's higher purpose. Test yourselves, and so discover that a cheerful heart is lively and this bow-wood, under hardship.	purple
Meteu	Long ago, when bear and bison swarmed theforest and the prarie, then the great and mighty chieftain looked with love upon his children; saw them striving, fighting, battling with the evil that abounded, and he spoke and said in this wise:	blue
Meteu	You who love the haunts of nature, love the moonlight on the water, love the sunshine on the meadow, love the shadow of the forest, love the wind among the branches ever murmuring, ever singing, love the rushing of great rivers, through the palisades of pine trees, love the thunder in the mountains whose innumerable echos leap and bound from crag to cliffside: listen to these admonitions for your guidence on your journey!	blue
Meteu	I, Meteu, heard this message whispered on the western mountains where the sun from eve to morning never sets, while beneath me as i climed and then stood listening slept in darkness, slept in shadow. You need seek no rocky summit: These high places are within you. All the natural world around you shows you clearly your reflection. This ordeal is but a pattern for a journey whose directions are the whispers, urgings, promptings deep within your hearts and spirits.	blue
Meteu	Therefore, from this moment onward, till you take the Obligation strictly keep a pledge of silence. hours spent in thoughtful silence helps us make the right decisions more than days and days of talking, help us feel the cords of sunlight tying all the world together. Soon you will be bound as brothers in this great and honored Order, but only if you are determined to fulfill its obligations out of love for one another.	blue
Meteu	Till then, let silence, like a bowstring, bind you each to every other, closer when the bow is tested.	blue
Allowat Sakima	Reverently, Meteu bids you henceforth keep the strictest silence. Cheerfully Nutiket bids you not to flinch from self-denial. Kichkinet will tell you of the lonelinewss ahead, and bid you sleep tonight apart from others. As the chieftain I exhort you, spend the day in arduous labor, working gladly, not begrudging, seek to serve, and thus be faithful to the high ideals and purpose of the Order of the Arrow.	red
Allowat Sakima	Friends, the ones who chose you need you. Who among you now is ready? Who will go upon this journey? You must choose. If you decide to stop and go no further now, you may withdraw without dicredit. if you are resolvede to master every challenge faithfully, if you accept the full ordeal, then firmly now take one step forward.	red
Allowat Sakima	My solemn duty now demands that each new friend shall test the bow, and doing so give proof in silence of his will to make the journey.	red
Allowat Sakima	As the warrior draws the arrow most trustworthy from the quiver, you were drawn from many others, for the first shaft of the hunter must be the straightest, must be the surest. if through many moons unflinching you hold fast to Scouting pledges, straight and true you each will travel as an arrow driven skyward, as an eagle soaring sunward. He who follows such a pathway in unwavering cheerful service will be seen by many others and, by inspiration, lead them.	red
Kichkinet	From the darkness, from the forest we have come with words of warning, bringing tokens of a struggle, an ordeal approaching swifly as a flock of field crows flying black across the sun. My friends, as kichkinet your guide, I bid you leave all daily cares behind you, leave the crowd and its opinions, lift your thoughts like sparks when from the fires's heart they shoot like arrows springing from the bow bent backward, from the bowstring smoothed with beeswax, loosed upon a lofty journey!	green
Kichkinet	It is not an easy journey, Sometimes even friends will mock you, tempt you or betray your promise, test your resoluton often, often try to make you faithless. All the world may seem against you and the path seem dark and lonely. All your strenth will be required when you face isolation which a leader often faces.	green
Kichkinet	So tonight beneath the heavens sleep alone upon your groudsheet. Be you steadfast as the polestar, self-reliant, undiscouraged.	green
Kichkinet	Then in your Ordeal tomorrow I will labor with you. With you I will listen, eating little. We will let the spirit fill us with the gladness of a dawning, of a springtime, of beginning. This ordeal is but a shadow of the rigors of the journey, but its joys also are shadows of the brighter, greater beatuy in a life of cheerful service.	green
